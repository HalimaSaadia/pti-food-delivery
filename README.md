pti. is a food delivery website. I have implemented some cool feature in this website

- There is a navbar, banner, popular food, recommended food, footer and a form for adding new food. 

- There is a Popular food section where use can see poplar food and a Recommended food section where user can see the food recommended by the owner of organization.

- In popular food and recommended food section there is a form by which user can add new food the menu. After adding food user will be see it on menu. If user select isRecommended true  it will be shown in recommended section, if idPopular true is selected then it will be shown in the the popular section. user can also select both true and show in both section.

- To show all the food in those section instead of card I used a carousel. Carousel made those two section more organize and user-friendly

- Tool: To show food Item I use react-slick and customize it to look even more eye soothing. I use react-hook form to add food item. React-hook form is very useful to give user the specific error message and handle.
